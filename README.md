# How To: Android Soundboard
This repository contains a full working Android soundboard that is based on my YouTube playlist "How To: Android Soundboard"

This soundboard has the functions to share sounds, set sounds as ringtone or giving the user the ability to add his favorite sounds to a list of favorites.

If you just want to have a soundboard without the favorites function and database support take a look at my other repository:
https://github.com/CodeRedDev/SoundboardWithoutFavorites.git

I will add some extra repositories with some functions that are not included in the main soundboard tutorials.
